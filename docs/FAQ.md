Brahma creates and manages a host of novel DeFi components and strategies by abstracting complexity and making DeFi accessible to the masses. Brahma's research-backed, experimental approach strives to create an "Investverse" starting with generating a sustained yield on top of your crypto assets. We unlock new portals for liquidity by paving way for autonomous and algorithm-led architectures.

Aastra is the first product out of Brahma's investverse. It aims to create structured strategies on top of DeFi protocols to create sustainable yield for anyone, starting with liquidity provisioning over AMM's.
