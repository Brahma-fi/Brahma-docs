---

## **What is Brahma?**

Brahma creates and manages a host of novel DeFi components and strategies by abstracting complexity and making DeFi accessible to the masses. Brahma's research-backed, experimental approach strives to create an "Investverse" starting with products focused on generating a non-speculative, sustained yield on crypto assets. We unlock new portals for liquidity by paving way for autonomous and algorithm-led architectures.

## **What is Aastra?**

Aastra is the first product out of Brahma's investverse. It aims to create structured strategies on top of DeFi protocols to create sustainable yield for anyone, starting with liquidity provisioning over AMM's.
The first instrument that went live on Aastra is AASTRA-ETHPUT. It creates a synthetic Put selling instrument on top of UNI V3, which replicates the same payoff structure as selling a put option.

## **How does Aastra work?**

> [➡️ User Guide](./AastraUserGuide.md)

A user deposits USDC to the instrument and our autonomous contracts execute the trades (selecting the range order, strike price and rebalance dates) as per our parameterization.

## **Are you audited?**

No, we are not audited yet. We have performed an extensive self audit on our contracts, which you can see in our audit report [here](https://brahma-fi.github.io/Brahma-docs/SelfAudit/).

## **Is there any risk?**

There are couple of risks associated with the strategies, contracts and platforms. Strategies are tested but do not guarantee future results. There might be some risks in the smart contracts and thus we advise caution when you are interacting with them, please check the Self audit report available here.
We are building on top of major DeFi platforms and there can be a problem with the 3rd party code and contracts, please do your own research before putting money in the smart contract.
