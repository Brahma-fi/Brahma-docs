<span style="color:#505050">Yield instruments built on top AMMs</span>

---

Aastra is the first product out of Brahma's investverse. Aastra sets out to be an ecosystem of structured strategies on top of DeFi protocols, which create sustainable yield for anyone, starting with liquidity provisioning over AMM's.

### **AASTRA-ETHPUT**

Our first instrument is built for users seeking to generate yield and liquidity providers aiming to use their assets more efficiently.
This instrument mirrors selling put options on ETH-USDC pair by leveraging Uniswap V3's concentrated liquidity mechanism. Users are issued AASTRA-ETHPUT (ERC-20 tokens) in return for their USDC position.
