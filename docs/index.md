## **Introducing Brahma**

Brahma creates and manages a host of novel DeFi components and strategies by abstracting complexity and making DeFi accessible to the masses. Brahma's research-backed, experimental approach strives to create an "Investverse" starting with generating a sustained yield on top of your crypto assets. We unlock new portals for liquidity by paving way for autonomous and algorithm-led architectures.
