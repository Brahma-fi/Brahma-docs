The goal of Brahma is to decentralize the protocol, and have the protocol run by the community in the future. As we write this, we accept that this future requires time and careful planning, as 100% decentralisation from the beginning is not possible.

The DAO will be responsible for the following changes to the protocol (though we accept, that at the inception, the decision comes from the core team and the shift to a pure DAO structure will happen over time, for which the community will be updated via Brahma's communication channels):

- Grant/Revoke rules
- Deploy/Revoke new yield-bearing instruments
- Deploy stablecoins
- Add/remove incentives for the stakeholders
- Upgrade contracts and oracles
- Deploy Protocol treasury
- Integrate new DeFi protocols
- Integrate and launch on different chains
- Deploy/Revoke new products over the DeFi rails
- Employ and reimburse contributors
- Grants and funding to teams building on Brahma.

We'll keep this section up-to-date as we move forward. You can join the #governance channel on our Discord server for more insights and discussions.
