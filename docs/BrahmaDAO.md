The goal of Brahma is to decentralize the protocol and a future where the protocol is run by the community, but as we write this we accept that this future is sometime away as 100% decentralisation from the beginning is not possible.

The DAO will be responsible for the following changes to the protocol, though we accept at the inception the decision comes from the core team and the shift to pure DAO structure will happen over time and the community will be updated via Brahma's communication channels.

- Grant/Revoke rules
- Deploy/Revoke new yield-bearing instruments
- Deploy stablecoins
- Add/remove incentives for the stakeholders
- Upgrade contracts and oracles
- Protocol treasury deployments
- Integrate new DeFi protocols
- Integrate and launch on different chains
- Deploy/Revoke new products over the DeFi rails
- Employ and reimburse contributors
- Grants and funding to teams building on Brahma.

We'll keep this section updated as when we move towards that direction, you can join #governance channel on our Discord server.
